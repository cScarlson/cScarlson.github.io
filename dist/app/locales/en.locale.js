    "CONTENT:ABOUT:P:1": `Growing up in a fairly sizable family, it wasn't difficult to find enough players for just about any pickup sport imaginable -- sometimes a stretch of the imagination. Though hockey was my top pick, resources were not always abundant and I ended up playing competitive soccer -- Club & High School -- throughout adolescense and continue to join leagues when I can. During my stay on the "B-Team", I was happy to play for a team heralded as "the best passing team in the state", according to many college recruiters. Around the time I was pulled up to the "A-Team" for Club I was entering High School and enduring some of the "most physically demanding tryouts in the country" and either sleeved as Captain or doubling for both Varsity and another team. I don't have a lot to prove to myself about my physical fortitude and I have now more or less retired my ego to simply lifting & running regularly.`,
    "CONTENT:ABOUT:P:2": `Starting around the age of high school, I began learning and practicing music production and dabbled as a DJ. Not long after, my father -- who is also a Software Engineer -- brought me to one of his "boring book stores", spent <i>way</i> more time than usual, bought a book, and slapped it to my gut as we walked back to the car and said "that's yours, do with it what you wish". I worked in the bars at the time as a barback, which gave me plenty of downtime after setup to dedicate to learning CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Right away, I decided I found code to be a thing of beauty and started "DudesThatKnowStuff" with a friend who was learning SEO at the time.`,
    "CONTENT:ABOUT:P:3": `Saving the best for last, I am a happy husband and "fur daddy" to both a dog and a cat. These three components of my life are what give me strength to keep keeping on. Other than spending time with those beloved three, I enjoy spending time with other family members -- siblings, nephews, my father, and, until her passing, my mother. Beside that, here are a few of my favorite hobbies that also keep me busy...`,
