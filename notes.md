I don't want you coming back to me because you are on a hook, I want you coming back because it was cost effective in way that (see below) and because we've built a relationship through working together where you see me as your Digital Sidekick.

# Pitch Script
My mission is to provide as many professionals with a Web Presence as possible. A 4-pillar approach is used to drive simplicity, quality, speed and affordability. There are two schools of theory for building websites: one is to make things so complicated that you, the developer, are the only one who can maintain the site -- essentially Product Lock-In. This is bad capitalism, if you ask me. The other school of thought is what I would call _good capitalism_: drive firmly toward simplicity so that enhancing the website becomes increasingly easier and more cost-effective to maintain. I don't want you coming back to me because you are on a hook. I want you coming back because it is cost-effective and we've built a relationship through working together where you see me as your Digital Sidekick.

# Intro
We make sites that pop! A Pop Site is an attractive site that came into existence quickly and gives you a presence at some point on the web. More importantly, it is a website that you can afford whether you are just starting out or are seasoned professional and one that you are proud of sharing with your clients & colleagues. It is one that makes your secondary income pop. It is one to make your revenue & sales pop and one to get you that much closer to popping a bottle of Champagne when you've broken away from the corporate gridlock.

# Our 4-Pillar Approach gets you...
- A quick turnaround. Years of expertise allows you to get a quality digital presence so you can quickly begin scaling your brand.
- A attractive, personal Web Presence that makes you stand out. You audience gets to enjoy learning about how you stand out.
- Mobile Friendliness & Responsive Design. Your audience gets a premium experience from any device.
- Adaptability of your content. If you want to add another language to you site -- Spanish, French, etc -- it's ready for that.
- Portability of your content. Your content can be easily ported to another platform if you upgrade your site or hand it off to another team.
