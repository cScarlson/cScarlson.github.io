Pricing can be _ballparked_ and most clients are commonly pleased with **the 3-Tier Flat Fee pricing framework we always strive for**:

#### 3-Tier Flat Fee Pricing Framework
- Tier 1: $500 - $700. e.g: a standard, 4-5 page Static Content Site.
- Tier 2: $1000 - $1500. e.g: a 5+ page site, external integrations, higher user interaction.
- Tier 3: $2000 - $4000. e.g: many pages, heavy user interaction, special tooling & integrations.

As these tiers are only _educated guesses_ based on what most clients need, the tier which your own Web Presence aligns with is completely _dependent upon the complexity of needs required by your website_. It is also worth noting: we always aim to drive our clients toward simplicity at first so that one may see the quickest turn-around at the least expensive cost. As an example, _the site you are on right now would be quoted around the lower end of "Tier 1".

Because most clients need little-to-no maintenance after initial launch and our goal is to provide as many people with a Web Presence as possible, ongoing maintenance -- enhancements, troubleshooting, consultation -- is charged hourly. Again, these rates depend on the complexity of needs as we assess them together. These rates can _roughly_ be ballparked as:

#### Post-Delivery Enhancement Rates
- Simple: $45/hour. e.g: label changes, headers, other minor text/copy changes, and minor syling or fixes.
- Intermediate: $65/hour. e.g: reformatting of content & layout, UI & UX changes, difficult bugs, etc.
- Complex: $120/hour. e.g: new integrations with external services, complex fixes, etc.

The first, **initial consultation is FREE**! Consultations after the first are charged at $20 an hour. However, this charge is easily waived when provided a _mean Latte_, a _wicked-good Hazy API_, awesome company shwag, ... you get the point. We follow the nominal practice of charging for the first hour automatically (just like an Electrician). It is good to mention, after delivery, most customers decide _it is a wise idea to bundle simple changes together_ so that **you are getting the most for your money on the hourly rate**.
