## Why Pop Site Technology?

#### The Reality
Online website builders always claim utter simplicity but unfortunately never live up to their promise. Should it be so hard to attain a basic Web Presence and scale as you go? You need someone in your corner who knows how to navigate these waters without getting caught by the undertow. Not everyone can be an expert in technology while dedicating their focus to another profession. Not everyone who can, has the privilege of time they can commit to its mastery. Pop Site Technology does this because our business & passion _is_ software.

All too often the attention & resouces go to large organizations that require intensive scalability in their technology because they experience intensive scaling in their business. These companies have usually hit escape velocity, some only liftoff. Whatever the case, these organizations are typically propelled by a metric ton of Angel Investment before they ever see any clearance. This is _not_ everybody. Where is one to go if they are simply looking to have an attractive Web Presence and scale from the ground up?

#### The Solution
Pop Site Technology provides professionals with the ability to break away from the corporate grid and become more self-sustainable in their career. The promise we can make to our clients is that we will always fight to find the most affordable solution with the highest quality product and be your digital sidekick along the way.

#### The Process
After filling out the form, you'll be contacted by a member of our team to set up a (free) Initial Consultation. During the initial consultation, we will discuss what your Web Presence needs are. After this, we will be back in contact after assessing the technical implications of the project requirements and provide you with a hard & fast quote. If any changes in requirements are necessary a new hard quote will be issued. After written agreement, you may be asked for any & all digital assets required for the project -- text/copy, images & logos, branding data, video & audio files, external links & social media handles, and any other files & documents or particularities that are part of your site's makeup. We try to allow our internal designers to perform the task of _Professional Theming, Layout & UI/UX Design_ for the quickest turnaround. However, if you have adamant requirements around those aesthetics, it is necessary to bring this up during the initial consultation. Otherwise, our professionals will assume the task and any changes will be billed accordingly.
